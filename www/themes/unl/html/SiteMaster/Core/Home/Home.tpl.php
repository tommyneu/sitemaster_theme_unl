        <dt>Overrides</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes a notice or error is not actually a problem. We let you override them so they don&rsquo;t appear in future scans.</dd>

        <dd>Your sites are automatically scanned once a month, and you will receive an email if anything has changed. You can also see changes over time for each metric.</dd>
